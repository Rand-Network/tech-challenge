## REST API - Backend (Node.JS + Express) Coding Challenge

### Context
Our frontend team require of new implementations on the API to work on new designs for the mobile app. We need to provide them with some info related to the users, like the KYC (idendity verification) status or the transactions made on the app.
We need to define the models and routes to fullfill that requirements.

### Product requirements

As a product owner:

- [ ] I want an endpoint that returns last KYC status of an specific user
- [ ] I want an endpoint that returns list of all transactions (more recent first) and the current balance (must be calculated) of an specific user
- [ ] I want to be able to create new users, using the email and full name

Create the Node.JS application that satisfies all must-have requirements above, plus any nice-to-have requirements you wish to include.

For that, youâ€™ll need to connect to a DB. Connection string will be provided.
