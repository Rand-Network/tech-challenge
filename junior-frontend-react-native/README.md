## App dashboard - Junior Frontend (React Native) Conding Challenge

### Context
Our users want to have some more information on their dashboard, and many of them asked us to add their balance and list of transactions.
This app needs to display the list of transactions and the total balance of the account.

### Product requirements

- [ ] I want to see my account balance
- [ ] I want to see the list of transactions in the main page (last 5)
- [ ] I want to see the full list of transactions when I press on `See all`
- [ ] I want to see a negative transactions every 3 items
